# The World (an ASP .NET project done by some software dev students)

This is just a small project that me and a few friends of mine did for school. It's designed to be an aonline forum where registered users can create threads and reply to them
It's not perfect and may have some security flaws, but I encourage you to take a look at it and experiement on it if you'd like :). Thanks to (on Discord):
- KingWeeb#0842 (for creating the tutorial video on how to use The World)
- eggysauce#3726 (also for creating the tutorial video)
- Nakshi#2726 (for helping Martin with creating The World)
- and Mintmaru#2717 (for being the main dev who did most of the coding on this)
- and me I guess lol I just made this public repo and a private one for all of to work off of
